		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			I'm a Computer Science grad from Texas A&M University with minors in Math and Business. Between Cum Laude honors and multiple Dean's List appearances, my time there wasn't just about chasing gradesâ€”it was about mastering the process. I enjoyed approaching tough problems with both structure and intuition, and learning where logic meets user experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Professionally and personally, I lean into the kind of work that doesn't always show up in tutorialsâ€”building backend logic that's resilient, refining UI details until they feel frictionless, or finding the root cause behind obscure overlay glitches. I enjoy the quiet kind of problem-solving, where progress is measured in reduced friction and better flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			I value clarity, consistency, and iteration. Whether I'm testing edge cases in a JavaFX interface, organizing cloud resources across AWS, or structuring data relationships in SQL, I care about how things scale, how they feel, and how they fail. The best code tells a storyâ€”and I like writing those stories one well-named function at a time.
